* for clause ----> which is used to hold the alert for certain period of time 
* Linux commands 
    - ps ax | grep <process-name> ex:- prometheus---> to search for the process ID
    - kill -HUP <process-ID>----> to stop the process
* when we want to segregate alerts based on critical, warning, and firing, we need to use labels in alerting rules.
    - for prometheus alerting labels, key value pairs is user defaind, not a pre defaind.
ALERT MANAGER:-
* alert manager is a tool which takes alerts from each of prometheus server and notify the user using various channels like slake SNS etc.
* alert manager is on of the component in prometheus configuration.

SLACK AND PROMETHEUS INTEGRATION 
================================

things to do slack end
-----------------------
* Go to slack official website and create a slack account there. There you can find create workspace click on that and procede with entering details.
* once channel has been created we need to install incoming webhooks which gives us the uniq URL which is used to integrate prometheus alert manager and slack.
* click on more button on left side bar and select apps and search for incoming webhooks
* when installing incoming webhooks they asks you for channel---> select the channel---> there you will find a uniq URL. make a note of that URL

thing to do prometheus alert manager
-------------------------------------
* open the alert manager config file and edit at the receiver main configuration as below 
- name: db-user
  slack_configs:
  - channel: '#prometheus'
    api_url: <enter the copied url from slack end>
    title: 'node_exporter is down'
    text: 'node_exporter is down for more than 2 minutes'



BLACK BOX EXPORTER
===================
* Black box exporter is a probing exporter which is used to moniter the network endpoints such as HTTP,HTTPS,DNS,ICMP and TCP.
* On probing it give detailed metric about the request.

use cases:-
----------
* Used when we dont have a clear knowledge of system intenally.
* Used to measure responce time of a HTTP or HTTPS endpoint URLs.
* To resolve DNS responce times to recover the network latency issues of a application.
* To check availabilty of your services, their up time, network health and other things.

process:-
----------
* prometheus makes get request to the black box exporter using a modules.
* black box executes appropriate porbe to get metric from the targer for example,
    - when prometheus wants to watch prometheus.io.
    - prometheus makes a get request call to black box exporter through a module called ICMP.
    - exporter will executes a porbe to get metrics from pormetheus.io.

General notes:-
---------------
* in <black box url>/metrics has the black box metrics such as black box cpu and memory utilization. 
* in <black box url>/probes we can find the target metrics that are scraped.
